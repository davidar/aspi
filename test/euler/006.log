>>> % 6. What is the difference between the sum of the squares and the square of the sums?
>>> #sum((1..100) ** 2)?
--> what(D) :- D = #sum { C : aggregation((1),C) }.
    aggregation((1),B) :- A = 1 .. 100, B = A ** 2.
that: 338350.

>>> #sum(1..100) ** 2?
--> what(D) :- C = #sum { B : aggregation((2),B) }, D = C ** 2.
    aggregation((2),A) :- A = 1 .. 100.
that: 25502500.
