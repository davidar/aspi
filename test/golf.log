>>> factor[P+Q, P*Q]: pair(P i2, Q (>).P i2).
--> factor(J,E,F) :- A = MuP, B = MuQ, E = A+B, C = MuP, D = MuQ, F = C*D, G = MuP, i2(G), I = MuQ, I>H, H = MuP, i2(I), J = pair(G,I).
understood.

>>> factor[2, (-15)]?
--> what(D) :- factor(D,B,C), B = 2, A = 15, C = -A.
that: pair(-3,5).

>>> factor[(-22), 85]?
--> what(D) :- factor(D,B,C), A = 22, B = -A, C = 85.
that: pair(-17,-5).

>>> factor[6, (-16)]?
--> what(D) :- factor(D,B,C), B = 6, A = 16, C = -A.
that: pair(-2,8).

>>> thanks.
YOU'RE WELCOME!
